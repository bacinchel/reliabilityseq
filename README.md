Reliability sequence for Polar Codes

This repository contains a C++ implementation for calculating the reliability sequence for Polar Codes. 

## Usage
Use the code that inputs the block length and values of the first-order Bhattacharyya parameter i.e. Z(W^1) and Z(W^2) and outputs reliability sequence for Polar Encoding. For detailed description refer to the thesis mentioned under Citation.
